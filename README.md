# Pompeii

This is a light theme for neovim (with a dark variant), loosesly based on [vim-colors-duochrome](https://github.com/sdothum/vim-colors-duochrome).

It has warm paper background and high contrast (but muted) text color, minimalistically applied so it look mostly black.

## Purpose

Be easy at the eyes, while maintaining a dark text on light background scheme.

Writing code should not look as if some fantasy creature spits rainbows over your editor.

## Installation & Usage

With [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) you add this to the `.vimrc`:

```
Plug 'ivanhernandez/pompeii'
```

Then:

```
set background=light
colorscheme pompeii
```
